# PayPal_multi_prod_purchase
A basic PayPal site w/ Bootstrap. Need working server for this project. SQL file included.

*currently the Paypal site does not redirect to the correct webpage after the 'return to merchant' button is selected. To date, I have not actually uploaded to a production server. 1-13-2020.
